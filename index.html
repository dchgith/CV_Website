          <h3>Web Design</h3>
          <p>From a young age I have always had a keen interest in computers and what makes them tick. Over the years however, my interest has shifted towards the development and design of websites. Having a previous career in Web Development I am eager to get back to it and produce amazing designs to be seen around the world.</p>

          <h3>Coding</h3>
          <p>As well as the coding skills required for Web Devlopment, my interest has spanned out into the vast and ever expanding world of software development allowing me to obtain new coding skills such as C++, Python or even JavaScript. I am always willing to tackle and learn any coding language that is thrown at me.</p>

          <h3>Graphic Design</h3>
          <p>During my previous career as a Web Devloper, part of my day to day duties was to create logos and graphics for clients using various applications such as Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. Although this may not be applicable to my current role as a tech support engineer, I do like to use these in my spare time when creating sample projects, such as the website you are currently viewing.</p>
